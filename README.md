# LangApps

## This repository currently contains four separate applications:

### 1. LangMap 
- An Angular + agm application currently in the works that displays a world map and allows the user to see stats for languages in a separate panel.

- Future versions of this site will include a separate application within, that allows the user to import custom language lessons + corresponding audio, with the ability to track progress for each word, grammar concept, etc.

### 2. A small, completed practice mongoDB project with 87 Maltese verbs, using PyMongo.

### 3. Sanna 

- A dictionary application for the Sanna/Cypriot Maronite Arabic language, written in Python's Flask

- Database schema & data are complete, need to mongoimport dictionary data in a mongo database and finish the project

- To be hosted on Heroku summer 2019.

### 4. LangShack
- Currently hosting the original version of my official website, written in Python's Django.

- LangShack is currently being redesigned and will host numerous Python and Angular applications in the future.

- LangShack will host applications displaying linguistic research data & more.

- This is no longer used, but the code is there for anyone who wants to see how I wrote this application (completed in May 2017, revisions in 2018)

- __Selenium__ script using the **Page-class model** available to view in LangShack/qaTests/features 

- An updated version of my site will be integrated with LangMap (& subsequent future apps) eventually.
